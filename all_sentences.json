      "- The test methods are not all inclusive and \nmay not apply in all situations.",
      "- Additional sources such as penetration testing and red team \nassessment results may be effective sources of evidence for select metrics.",
      "- The “Assessor’s Best Practices” section has replaced the “Additional Notes” section this year.",

      "- The guide is a companion document to the FY 2025 IG FISMA metrics1 and OMB M-25-042 \nwhich provides guidance to IGs to assist in their FISMA evaluations.",
      "- Within the context of the maturity model, OMB believes that achieving managed and measurable \n(level 4) or above represents an effective level of security.",
      "- The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology (NIST) provides additional guidance for determining the effectiveness of \nsecurity controls.3  If an agency does not reach level 4 or above for any metric, IGs are required \nto provide a summary in DHS’s CyberScope portal as to why that metric only achieved level 3 or \nbelow.",
      "- This provides the agency with adequate justification for not reaching an effective level of \nsecurity.",
      "- For example, “The Agency \n \n1 Final FY 2025 IG FISMA Reporting Metrics (cisa.gov) \n2 Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-25-04 \n3 NIST SP 800-53, Rev.",
      "- IGs have the discretion to determine whether an \nagency is effective in each of the Cybersecurity Framework Function (i.e.",
      "- govern, identify, \nprotect, detect, respond, and recover) and whether the agency’s overall information security \nprogram is effective based on the results of the determinations of effectiveness in each function \nand the overall assessment.",
      "- Therefore, an IG has the discretion to determine that an agency’s \ninformation security program is effective even if the agency does not achieve managed and \nmeasurable (level 4).",
      "- Some agencies might uniquely meet these maturity levels, acknowledging \nthe diverse nature of federal agencies' missions and resources.",
      "- Reflecting OMB’s shift in emphasis away from compliance in favor of risk management-based \nsecurity, IGs are encouraged to evaluate the IG metrics based on the risk tolerance and threat \nmodel of their agency and to focus on the practical security impact of weak control \nimplementations, rather than strictly evaluating from a view of compliance or the mere presence \nor absence of controls.",
      "- In response to the threat environment and technology ecosystem which continue to evolve and \nchange at a faster pace each year, OMB implemented a new framework regarding the timing and \nfocus of assessments in FY 2022.",
      "- The goal of this new framework was to provide a more flexible \nbut continued focus on annual assessments for the federal community.",
      "- This effort yielded two \ndistinct groups of metrics: Core and Supplemental.",
      "- Core Metrics  \nThere are 20 core metrics.",
      "- The core metrics are assessed annually by the IGs and represent a \ncombination of Administration priorities, high impact security processes, and essential functions \nnecessary to determine security program effectiveness.",
      "- Supplemental Metrics   \nSupplemental metrics are not considered a core metric but represent important activities \nconducted by security programs and contribute to the overall evaluation and determination of \nsecurity program effectiveness.",
      "- For FY 2025, the supplemental metrics comprise of five new \nmetrics designed to gauge the maturity of agencies’ cybersecurity governance practices and \nimplementation of key components of ZTA.",
      "- These five metrics will be evaluated by IGs and \nscored in FY 2025.",
      "- IG wills consider the supplemental metric ratings when making the domain \nand function level maturity determinations.",
      "- In contrast, the responsibility for \ntracking key enterprise risks and their impacts on objectives is held by top-level corporate \nofficers and board members who have fiduciary and reporting duties not performed anywhere \nelse in the enterprise.4 \n \nThe terms “auditor”, “assessor”, “evaluator”, “IG”, and “OIG” are often used interchangeably.",

      "- The following alternative evidence approaches could complement \ntraditional documentation: \n1.",

      "- These alternative forms of evidence may be particularly valuable when traditional documentation \ndoes not fully capture the effectiveness of an agency’s security program.",
      "- The intent of these \nsuggestions is to support a holistic assessment approach that values security effectiveness \nalongside formal documentation.",
      "- It may require several recommendations to get that \nmetric to the next level, however this provides the agency with specific guidance and the \nopportunity to make steady and visible progress.",
      "- This approach would also allow the assessors \nto follow-up on agency actions taken as part of their recommendation follow-up processes and/or \nthe next FISMA evaluation.",
      "- It is a matter of opinion, however generally a higher quantity of \nspecific recommendations is preferable over fewer broad recommendations.",
      "- OFIs and IMCs would be an “unofficial” recommendation that the \nassessor can issue in the report that does not get tracked in monthly reports and semi-annual \nreports (SAR), but rather just goes on record to emphasize the issue.",
      "- OFIs and IMCs could \nbecome recommendations over time (generally 1-2 years) if the POA&Ms or OFIs and IMCs are \nnot timely resolved.",
      "- Ordinarily, OIGs and Agency officials review and collaborate on recommendations to come to a \nmanagement decision.",
      "- This is either done through the agency’s official comments to the report \nor during recommendation follow-up.",
      "- During the management decision process it is critical that \nall parties are clear and agree upon the agency’s planned corrective action.",
