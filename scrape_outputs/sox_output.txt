alties set forth in this Act, the growing incidence of serious 
fraud offenses which are identified above, and the need to mod-
ify the sentencing guidelines and policy statements to deter, 
prevent, and punish such offenses; 
(2) consider the extent to which the guidelines and policy 
statements adequately address whether the guideline offense 
levels and enhancements for violations of the sections amended 
by this Act are sufficient to deter and punish such offenses, 
and specifically, are adequate in view of the statutory in-
creases in penalties contained in this Act; 
(3) assure reasonable consistency with other relevant di-
rectives and sentencing guidelines; 
(4) account for any additional aggravating or mitigating 
circumstances that might justify exceptions to the generally 
applicable sentencing ranges;
