What is ISO/IEC 27001?
- ISO/IEC 27001 is¬†the world's best-known standard for
information security management systems (ISMS)
.
- The ISO/IEC 27001 standard provides companies of any size and from all sectors of activity with guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system.
- Why is ISO/IEC 27001 important?
- With cyber-crime on the rise and
new threats
constantly emerging
, it can seem difficult or even impossible to manage cyber-risks.
- ISO/IEC 27001 promotes a holistic approach to information security: vetting people, policies and technology.
- An information security management system implemented according to this standard is a tool for
risk management, cyber-resilience
and
operational excellence.

- They gain efficiency and often
emerge as leaders within their industries
.
- ‚ö†
Risk example:
Criminals get hold of your clients‚Äô login details and sell them on the Darknet.
- ‚ö†
Risk example:
A staff member accidentally deletes a row in a file during processing.
- ‚ö†
Risk example:
Your enterprise database goes offline because of server problems and insufficient backup.
- An information security management system that meets the requirements of ISO/IEC¬†27001 preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.
- Is ISO 27001 the same as ISO/IEC 27001?
- Even though it is sometimes referred to as ISO 27001, the
official abbreviation
for the International Standard on requirements for information security management is ISO/IEC 27001.
- That is because it has been
jointly published by ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
.
- The number indicates that it was published under the responsibility of Subcommittee 27 (on Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection) of ISO‚Äôs and IEC‚Äôs Joint Technical Committee on Information Technology (ISO/IEC JTC 1).
- What is ISO/IEC 27001 certification and what does it mean to be certified to ISO 27001?
- Certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is one way to demonstrate to stakeholders and customers that you are
committed and able
to manage information securely and safely
.
- Holding a certificate from an accredited conformity assessment body may bring an additional layer of confidence, as an accreditation body has provided independent confirmation of the certification body‚Äôs competence.
- If you wish to use a logo to demonstrate certification, contact the certification body that issued the certificate.
- See full details about
use of the ISO logo
.
- As with other ISO management system standards, companies implementing ISO/IEC 27001 can decide whether they want to go through a certification process.
- ISO/IEC 27001 is widely used around the world.
- As per the ISO Survey 2022, over 70¬†000 certificates were reported in 150 countries and from all economic sectors, ranging from agriculture through manufacturing to social services.
